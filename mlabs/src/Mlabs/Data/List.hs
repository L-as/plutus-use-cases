{-# INLINEABLE take #-}

{- | 'take' @n@, applied to a list @xs@, returns the prefix of @xs@
 of length @n@, or @xs@ itself if @n > 'length' xs@.

 >>> take 5 "Hello World!"
 "Hello"
 >>> take 3 [1,2,3,4,5]
 [1,2,3]
 >>> take 3 [1,2]
 [1,2]
 >>> take 3 []
 []
 >>> take (-1) [1,2]
 []
 >>> take 0 [1,2]
 []

 It is an instance of the more general 'Data.List.genericTake',
 in which @n@ may be of any integral type.

{-# INLINEABLE sortOn #-}

{- | Sort a list by comparing the results of a key function applied to each
 element.  @sortOn f@ is equivalent to @sortBy (comparing f)@, but has the
 performance advantage of only evaluating @f@ once for each element in the
 input list.  This is called the decorate-sort-undecorate paradigm, or
 Schwartzian transform.

 Elements are arranged from lowest to highest, keeping duplicates in
 the order they appeared in the input.
